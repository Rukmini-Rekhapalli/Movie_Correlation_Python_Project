# Movie_Correlation_Python_Project

## Overview
 This Python project focuses on exploring and identifying correlations within a movie dataset sourced from Kaggle.com.The dataset used for the project can be
 downloaded from KaggleMovieDataset
 This project analyzes data from a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle , which contains information about movies. THE goal is to explore correlation between various movie attributes and gain insights into factors that might influence a movie's success.

## Getting started
1. ## Prerequisites##
2. before running the project ,ensure you have the following python libraries installed:
3. pandas
4. numpy
5. matplotlib
6. seaborn
7. you can install these libraries using pip 

## Overview
This Python project aims to analyze a dataset of movies obtained from Kaggle to identify correlations and trends among various movie attributes. The dataset used in this project is called `movies_dataset.csv`, which contains information about movies such as title, release year, genre, rating, and revenue.


## Data Source
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link: [Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yourusername/movies-dataset)

## Data Cleaning
Before performing any analysis, the dataset underwent a data cleaning process to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types. The following steps were performed:

1. Load the dataset from the CSV file.
2. Check for missing values and decide on an appropriate strategy (e.g., filling with zeros, dropping rows/columns).
3. Remove duplicate rows if any.
4. Convert data types to the correct format (e.g., converting release year to datetime).

## Analysis
The project includes various analyses and visualizations to explore correlations and trends within the movie dataset. Some of the analyses performed include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistics and visualizations to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables, such as revenue and budget.
- Genre Analysis: Examining the distribution of genres and their impact on movie success.
- Release Year Trends: Analyzing how the industry has evolved over time.
